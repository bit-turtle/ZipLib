# ZipLib

ZipLib is a lightweight C++11 library for working with ZIP archives with ease. The very useful feature of ZipLib is that **it is built around STL streams, no additional dependencies (boost) are required**.

It is a fork of https://bitbucket.org/wbenny/ziplib with own adjustments and unmerged fixes from issues and pull requests from the original repository.

## My Changes

- Replaced `std::ios::streampos` with `std::streampos` for compatibility
- That's it

## Features

- Compression/decompresion using the DEFLATE algorithm
- Storing/fetching files without compression
- Adding, editing and removing files and directories in the archive
- Support of the data descriptor
- Data flow is driven via STL streams, therefore there is no need to load huge amount of data into the memory
- Support of PKWare encryption
- Support of entry comments and archive comments
- Contains very usable stream classes in `ZipLib/streams` like memory stream, substream or teestream
- Contains functions for easy (de)serialization (`ZipLib/streams/serialization.h`)
- Project is using only C++11 standard libraries, therefore there IS NO dependency on 3rd party libraries (except of included zlib, which uses C standard library)
- Built around STL smart pointers
- Support of Windows and Linux

## Fork features

- Project files for building under WSL (Linux) using Visual Studio 2019 or newer.
- Removed dependency on zlib's CRC32 calculation in case its support is disabled.
- ZIP file support up to 4 GB.
- Ability to toggle support of specific compression methods. Define any of these macros for **both** ZipLib and your project:
  - `ZIPLIB_NO_BZIP2` - disable compression using bzip2 library.
  - `ZIPLIB_NO_LZMA` - disable compression using LZMA library.
  - `ZIPLIB_NO_ZLIB` - disable compression using zlib library.
